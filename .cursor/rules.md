# Cursor Rules for ai-smartcloudops

1. Follow the Phase Plan in `docs/phase_plan.md` exactly (Phase 0 â†’ Phase 7).
2. Do not overwrite unrelated files.
3. Write clean, modular, and testable code.
4. Keep all tests in `tests/` directory.
5. Use `pytest` for all validations.
6. Document manual vs Cursor tasks clearly in `docs/`.
