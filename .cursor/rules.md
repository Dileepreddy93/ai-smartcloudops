# Cursor Rules for ai-smartcloudops

1. Do not overwrite unrelated files.
2. Always follow the defined phase plan (Phase 0 â†’ Phase 5).
3. Write clean, modular, and testable code.
4. Keep all tests in `tests/` directory.
5. Use `pytest` for testing.
6. Document manual vs Cursor tasks clearly in `docs/`.
